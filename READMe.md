# My C++ Projects

Welcome to my repository of C++ projects! This repository contains five different projects that I have worked on. Each project focuses on different aspects and concepts of C++, demonstrating my progression and skills in the language. Below you will find a brief overview of each project. For a more detailed explanation, including the concepts used and what each project entails, please refer to the individual README.md file within each project's directory.

## 1. [Graphs&Algorithms](./CPP_EX1_24)

In this project, I implemented essential graph algorithms using a representation based on an adjacency matrix.

## 2. [Operators Graph](./CPP_EX2_24)

In this project, I expanded the `Graph` class to include operator overloads, allowing arithmetic and logical operations directly on graph objects represented by an adjacency matrix. 

- **Key Features:**
  - **Operator Overloads:** Implements arithmetic operations for adding and subtracting graphs, comparisons to evaluate graph equality or size, and scalar operations to adjust graph weights.
  - **Advanced Graph Operations:** Includes matrix multiplication to combine graphs and modify their structures.
