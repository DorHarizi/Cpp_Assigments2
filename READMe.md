# My C++ Projects

Welcome to my repository of C++ projects! This repository contains five different projects that I have worked on. Each project focuses on different aspects and concepts of C++, demonstrating my progression and skills in the language. Below you will find a brief overview of each project. For a more detailed explanation, including the concepts used and what each project entails, please refer to the individual README.md file within each project's directory.

## 1. [Graphs&Algorithms](./CPP_EX1_24)

In this project, I implemented essential graph algorithms using a representation based on an adjacency matrix.

## 2. [Graphs&Algorithms](./CPP_EX2_24)

In this project, I expanded the `Graph` class to include operator overloads, allowing arithmetic and logical operations directly on graph objects represented by an adjacency matrix. This enhancement includes operator overloads for addition, subtraction, and comparison of graphs, as well as operations that manipulate graph data, such as incrementing or scaling the adjacency matrix. This approach not only simplifies code that works with graphs but also integrates mathematical concepts typically associated with matrices in linear algebra.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Operator Overloads:** Implements arithmetic operations for adding and subtracting graphs, comparisons to evaluate graph equality or size, and scalar operations to adjust graph weights.
  - **Graph Algorithms:** Features like checking connectivity, finding shortest paths, detecting cycles, and determining bipartiteness of the graph.
  - **Advanced Graph Operations:** Includes matrix multiplication to combine graphs and modify their structures.
