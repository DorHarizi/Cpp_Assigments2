# My C++ Projects

Welcome to my repository of C++ projects! This repository contains five different projects that I have worked on. Each project focuses on different aspects and concepts of C++, demonstrating my progression and skills in the language. Below you will find a brief overview of each project. For a more detailed explanation, including the concepts used and what each project entails, please refer to the individual README.md file within each project's directory.

## 1. [Graphs&Algorithms](./Task1_Graphs_and_Algorithms)

In this project, I implemented essential graph algorithms using a representation based on an adjacency matrix.
