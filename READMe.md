# My C++ Projects

Welcome to my repository of C++ projects! This repository contains five different projects that I have worked on. Each project focuses on different aspects and concepts of C++, demonstrating my progression and skills in the language. Below you will find a brief overview of each project. For a more detailed explanation, including the concepts used and what each project entails, please refer to the individual README.md file within each project's directory.

## 1. [Graphs&Algorithms](./CPP_EX1_24)

In this project, I implemented essential graph algorithms using a representation based on an adjacency matrix.

## 2. [Operators Graph](./CPP_EX2_24)

In this project, I expanded the `Graph` class to include operator overloads, allowing arithmetic and logical operations directly on graph objects represented by an adjacency matrix. 

- **Key Features:**
  - **Operator Overloads:** Implements arithmetic operations for adding and subtracting graphs, comparisons to evaluate graph equality or size, and scalar operations to adjust graph weights.
  - **Advanced Graph Operations:** Includes matrix multiplication to combine graphs and modify their structures.

## 3. [Catan Game](./CPP_EX3_24)

This project implements the Catan game, focusing on board representation, player management, and game mechanics.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Board Management:** Implements the `Board` class to manage game resources and structures.
  - **Player Actions:** Includes the `Player` class to manage player resources, actions, and points.
  - **Game Flow:** Utilizes the `Catan` class to control the overall game flow, player turns, and determine the winner.
